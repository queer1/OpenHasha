OpenHasha
=========

Open source version of Hasha, a Mac OS X hash analyzing tool.

[Project Site](https://github.com/x43x61x69/OpenHasha)


Description
-----------

The project was partly based on a close source project "Hasha".

The source code served as an example of how Hasha works, it is, 
by no means, a commercial grade product. It might contain errors 
or flaws, and it was created for demonstration purpose only.

OpenHasha simply analyzes the hash string to provide possible 
basemap the unknown hash might be using.

A 10.9 SDK-based, pre-compiled version of OpenHasha was provided 
with the source for the convenience of those end-users without 
Xcode installed.
