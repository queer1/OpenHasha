It might contain errors \r\nor flaws, and it was created for demonstration purpose only.\r\n\r\nOpenHasha simply analyzes the hash string to provide possible \r\nbasemap the unknown hash might be using.\r\n\r\nA 10.9 SDK-based, pre-compiled version of OpenHasha was provided \r\nwith the source for the convenience of those end-users without \r\nXcode installed.\r\n\r\n\r\nChangelog\r\n---------\r\n\r\nv0.1:\r\n* Initial release.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2014  Cai, Zhi-Wei.\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
